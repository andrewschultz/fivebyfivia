>xyzzy
On the very east side of the world lie such repositories of hooliganism and pointless chance-taking as Backgammonton, Pokersfield or, worse, Yahtzeeburg. You dream of helping conquer them one day, but it is only a dream. A too-risky one at that.

Okay, let's end things early...
You're already at c3 in the center, so that saves time starting again. Time to re-summon the queenside rook and the kingside rook.

>dirs
There are eight directions your horse can travel, clockwise from north: northnortheast, northeasteast, southeasteast, southsoutheast, southsouthwest, southwestwest, northwestwest and northnorthwest.
That's a bit long, so you can abbreviate them NNE,  NEE,  SEE,  SSE,  SSW,  SWW, NWW, NNW or any possible permutations. The game will treat all similar permutations as identical, e.g. there is no practical difference between NNE, NEN and ENN.
You can toggle how the directions appear (long or short) in room descriptions with ABB or A.

This game should come with a walkthrough. However, if you need a refresher on your quest, simply X FIVEBYFIVIA DELENDA EST or just X. It's a bit short on details -- of course it is! Royalty tends to delegate like that.

Pawns and bishops do not appear in this game, so don't worry about them.
Knights (that's you) move one square vertically and two squares horizontally.
Rooks can move vertically or horizontally until there is an obstruction.
Queens can move vertically or horizontally or diagonally until there is an obstruction.
Kings can move one square adjacent, vertically or horizontally or diagonally, unless there is an obstruction.
Check occurs when one piece is attacking your king.
Checkmate is when you attack the enemy's king and he has no safe square nearby to flee to.
Stalemate is when the enemy has no legal moves, but the king is not under attack.
